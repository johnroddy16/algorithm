# a practice file for the heaps directory:

# a heap is a binary tree that is ordered differently from a binary search tree, with a heap each node will have a greater value than 
# than those of its descendents (parent nodes are always greater than child nodes)

# a heap is a complete tree 

# in heaps we can have duplicates 

# we can also make the top node be the smallest value and in that case all child nodes will be greater in value than their parent 

# max heap is with max value at the top and min heap is with the min value at the top 

# heaps are not ideal for searching

# heaps are good for keepig the max or min value at the top and quickly removing it 

print(1 // 2)  # integer division
