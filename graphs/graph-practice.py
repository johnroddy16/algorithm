# a practice file for the graphs directory:

# in graphs we have vertices (nodes) and edges
# the edges can be wieghted or non-weighted and can be directional (one way) or bi-directional (two way)
# trees are a form of graphs and ll are a form of trees 
# all trees are graphs, all ll are trees, therefor all ll are graphs 


x = {1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6, 7: 8,}

print(list(x.keys()))  # just testing how this works


y = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(y)

y.clear() 

y.clear()

y.append(1)

y.append(2)

# y.remove(3)  # will cause a value error at this point in the program 

print(y)
